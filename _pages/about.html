Our work focuses on <strong>shoreline change</strong>, <strong>erosion</strong>, <strong>waves</strong>, <strong>ice</strong>, and <strong>water level dynamics</strong> under the influence of climate variability and extreme events.</p> <p>Led by <strong>Dr. Hazem Abdelhady</strong>, the lab integrates <strong>physics-based hydrodynamic modeling</strong>, <strong>remote sensing</strong>, and <strong>machine learning</strong> to better understand how coastal systems evolve and to develop tools that support <strong>resilience and adaptation planning</strong> for vulnerable communities.</p> <p>Combining observational data with advanced numerical and AI-driven approaches, the Aggie CIS Lab bridges disciplines to address urgent environmental challenges at the intersection of <strong>climate, water, and coasts</strong>.</p> <p>If youâ€™re interested in joining the lab, please check the following <strong><a href="https://huhady.github.io/news/announcement_2.html">announcement</a></strong>.</p> </body></html>
