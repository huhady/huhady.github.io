Hazem Abdelhady's lab is starting in Fall 2025 in the Geography Department at Texas A&M University.

My research lab focuses on coastal processesâ€”from shoreline change and erosion to the dynamics of waves, ice, and water levels in lakes and ocean. By combining physics-based models with data-driven tools, I aim to improve forecasting and inform resilience adaptation strategies for vulnerable coastal communities.
