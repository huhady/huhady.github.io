## Join the Lab

I am actively recruiting Ph.D. students to join my research group in the **Geography Department at Texas A&M University**, starting in **Spring 2026 or Fall 2026**. The lab focuses on **coastal and nearshore processes**—including coastal change, wave dynamics, and the impacts of natural hazards—through a combination of **physics-based modeling** and **data-driven (AI/ML) approaches**. We aim to improve modeling and understanding of coastal hazards and to develop resilience strategies for vulnerable coastal communities.

If you are passionate about using computational tools to address pressing environmental and water resources challenges, I encourage you to apply by filling out **[this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeLNV-ouSULUIgJgmnMzEuo_0_z60VN76TfMMAdSM_Tljpk_Q/viewform?usp=header)**. All cadidates must sastify Texas A&M Graduate School and the Department of Geography requirements and shortlisted candidates will be asked to submit an offical application.

### Prospective Ph.D. Students

Depending on your background and interests, projects may focus on topics such as:
- Coastal erosion, sediment transport, and shoreline modeling  
- Simulating and forecasting ice cover and thermal dynamics in large lakes  
- Developing hybrid (AI + physics) models for coastal system prediction  
- Understanding interannual to decadal variability in coastal processes  

Applicants should hold an M.S. in one of the following or closely related fields prior to starting the Ph.D.:
- Physical Geography  
- Oceanography  
- Coastal and Ocean Engineering  
- Earth System Science  

Highly motivated students without an M.S. but with strong undergraduate research experience are also encouraged to apply.

While not strictly required, applicants with background and experience in one or more of the following areas will be given preference:
- Numerical modeling (e.g., FVCOM, Delft3D, WaveWatch III, XBeach, SWAN)  
- Machine learning or deep learning frameworks (e.g., PyTorch, TensorFlow)  
- Remote sensing or geospatial data analysis  
- Programming in Python, MATLAB  

If interested, please complete this **[Interest Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeLNV-ouSULUIgJgmnMzEuo_0_z60VN76TfMMAdSM_Tljpk_Q/viewform?usp=header)** to register your information. I will review submissions and follow up if your background aligns with current or upcoming opportunities. All cadidates must sastify Texas A&M Graduate School and the Department of Geography requirements and shortlisted candidates will be asked to submit an offical application.

### Master’s and Undergraduate Students

If you are currently at Texas A&M—or planning to start in Fall 2025—and are interested in research opportunities in our lab, please fill out the **[Interest Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeLNV-ouSULUIgJgmnMzEuo_0_z60VN76TfMMAdSM_Tljpk_Q/viewform?usp=header)** as well. Opportunities may be available for course credit, paid research assistantships, or summer internships. Prior experience is helpful but not required if you’re excited to learn and contribute.
