I am a postdoctoral researcher at the School for Environment and Sustainability (SEAS), University of Michigan – Ann Arbor, in a joint appointment with the Cooperative Institute for Great Lakes Research (CIGLR), where I study how climate variability and extreme events shape large lake systems—especially the Great Lakes. My work integrates coastal and hydrodynamic modeling, remote sensing, and machine learning to better understand and predict environmental change.

My research focuses on coastal processes—from shoreline change and erosion to the dynamics of waves, ice, and water levels. By combining physics-based models with data-driven tools, I aim to improve forecasting and inform climate adaptation strategies for vulnerable coastal communities.

Starting Fall 2025, I will join the Geography Department at Texas A&M as an assitant professor.
