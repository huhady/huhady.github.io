I am a currently a postdoctoral researcher at the School for Environment and Sustainability (SEAS), University of Michigan – Ann Arbor, in a joint appointment with the Cooperative Institute for Great Lakes Research (CIGLR), where I study how climate variability and extreme events shape large lake systems—especially the Great Lakes. My work integrates coastal and hydrodynamic modeling, remote sensing, and machine learning to better understand and predict environmental change.

I hold a PhD from Purdue University with dual majors in Civil and Computational Engineering and a certificate in Geospatial Information Science. Across academia, government, and applied research, I’m driven by the challenge of translating complex environmental data into actionable insights for managing freshwater and coastal systems in a changing climate.

Starting Fall 2025, I will join the Geography Department at Texas A&M as an assitant professor.
